# Introduction to Scikit-learn (supervised learning)

## Glance at machine learning

__Machine learning__ is a kind of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms which improve their behavior automatically with experience from interaction with the real world. Machine learning algorithm constructs a model with sample data, or more commonly, training data. The model makes predictions with no dependence on explicit programming. The machine learning technology has been widely applied today, include but not limit to computer vision and natural language processing.
