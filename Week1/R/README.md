# Week 1 
this week is mainly talked about what is R: the history of R and why learn R

## History of R: R is an offshoot of the S language
It was born around 1980 and is widely used in the field of statistics. 
R can be considered as an implementation of the S language.
S is an interpreted language developed by AT&T Bell Labs for data exploration, statistical analysis, and graphing.
The original implementation of the S language was mainly S-PLUS, 
a commercial software based on the S language and further refined by the Statistical Sciences Division of MathSoft Inc.
An R system was later developed by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka of the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and other volunteers. 
R can be seen as an implementation of the S language developed by Bell Labs. 
the S language is also the basis for S-Plus. 
the syntax of the two programs is almost identical, with perhaps only minor differences in functions, 
the programs can be easily ported to one program, and many of the programs of one can be used in R with minor modifications.


## Why learn R: With statistics becoming popular, the R programming language is one of the most widely used in statistics science field.

It is leading the way in cloud computing.
In Redmond's recent ranking of programming languages, R was ranked 13th, 
IEEESpectrum's list of the most popular programming languages ranked R third among data languages
according to TiobeSoftware, which ranked R as the 18th most-used programming language, after ranking it 44th a year earlier.
The PYPL (Programming Language Popularity Index) is based on the frequency of searches for language tutorials on Google
Besides, R Programming applications compass the universe from hypothetical, computational statistics sciences
for example, astronomy, chemistry, and genomics to practical applications in business, 
drug advancement, finance, health care, marketing, medicine and much more
