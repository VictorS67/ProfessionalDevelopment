# eneral introduction about NumPy & SciPy

## overall introduction
Python is a powerful language for rich source of data science tools. And NumPy and SciPy family is one of the packages frequently used in mathematical computation in Python, which is a good replacement for MatLab. If you are seeking for free and efficient software, SciPy might be a good choice.

SciPy family has a modules for linear algebra, optimization, interpolation, image processing and so on, which are often used in fields like statistics, data secience & analysis, machine learning and engineering. The NumPy array is strong in time and memory efficiency, which supports fast computation, and much more efficient than barely using iterations. The NumPy array is strong because it has been optimized by parallel programming and more advanced algorithm, I will list examples later.

"(from scipy official webpage) SciPy (pronounced “Sigh Pie”) is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. In particular, these are some of the core packages:"
