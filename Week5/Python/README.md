**PyTorch** is an open source library in Python for machine learning developped by Facebook, based on the package *Torch*. Except for machine learning, this package is also used in computer vision and natural language processing. There are mainly two high-level features for PyTorch library:
- strong GPU acceleration by applying NumPy-like tensors
- Automatic differentiation system for deep neural neural network

## Features of PyTorch library
1. Tensors: vector in PyTorch (like NumPy array)
2. Datasets & DataLoaders: load and manipulate dataset
3. Transforms: transform and manipulate data representation in PyTorch (ex., Tensor)
4. Model: build models, like convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), generative adversarial network (GAN)
5. Automatic differentiation: solving backpropagation - find gradient for loss with each parameter in the model in each turn of training
6. optimization: optimize the parameters (ex., gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent)
7. save and load model
