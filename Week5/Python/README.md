**PyTorch** is an open source library in Python for machine learning developped by Facebook, based on the package *Torch*. Except for machine learning, this package is also used in computer vision and natural language processing. There are mainly two high-level features for PyTorch library:
- strong GPU acceleration by applying NumPy-like tensors
- Automatic differentiation system for deep neural neural network
