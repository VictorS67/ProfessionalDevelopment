# How to learn R (in General)
## General introduction
Learning R can be difficult and easy at the same time, especially if you have no programming experience or are more familiar working with point-and-click 
statistical software versus a real programming language. 
This learning path is mainly for novice R users that are just getting started 
but it will also cover some of the latest changes in the language that might appeal to more advanced R users.
Step 1: Learn how to Set-Up your own R station in your on device
Step 2: Understanding the R Syntax step bu step
Step 3: Knowing the core of R -> packages
Step 4: The Data Analysis Workflow
step 5: Practice make you perfect

## Learn it step by step!
### Step 1
Before you can really start working with R, you need to download a version of it on your computer and in most of the time you will work it on your local R station. 
Since the birth of R in 1993, R has evolved and been released in different versions with interesting names such as World-Famous Astronaut and Wooden Christmas-Tree. 
installing R is pretty straightforward from the Comprehensive R Archive Network ( CRAN) has binaries for Linux, Mac and Windows.
If you are a student in schools like UofT, you can find a design version of R in your school website, and taht version will be suggested for student.

Once R is installed, you should consider installing an integrated development environment for R (although you can also work with the basic R console if you prefer). 
Two fairly mature IDEs are RStudio and Architect. (personal suggestion, start your R learning form Rstudio will be much easier for you) 
If you like graphical user interfaces, you should take a look at R-commander specificlly.

### Step 2
Learning the syntax of a programming language like R is very similar to the way you would learn a natural language like French or Spanish: 
The key is learning it by practice & by using. 
One of the best ways to learn R by doing is through tutorials
You can find tutorials in both your orginal R and other teachng streams.

For my own personal experience I will give some suggestions:
Jared Landerâ€™s R for Everyone
R in Action by Robert Kabacoff
The free introduction to R manual by CRAN
Note that: Reading a book is the most systemic way of learning, but to due with a very specific question, you better search the question on youtube (save you a lot of time!)
